        <b class="p-color"><i>Ernesto "Che" Guevara </i></b> (Spanish: [ˈtʃe
        ɣeˈβaɾa];[3] 14 May 1928[4] – 9 October 1967) was a Cuban-Argentinian
        Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat,
        and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his
        stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of
        rebellion and a global insignia in popular culture.[5]

        As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America
        and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he
        witnessed.[6][7] His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as
        the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States
        prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President
        Jacobo Árbenz, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of
        the United Fruit Company solidified Guevara's political ideology.[6]
        Later in Mexico City, Guevara met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their
        26th of July Movement, and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with
        the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio
        Batista.[8] Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was
        promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the two-year
        guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.[9]

        Following the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles
        in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing
        squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary
        tribunals,[10] instituting agrarian land reform as minister of
        industries, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign,
        serving as both national bank president and instructional director for
        Cuba's armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of
        Cuban socialism. Such positions also allowed him to play a central role
        in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs
        Invasion,[11] and bringing Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to
        Cuba, which preceded the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.[12] Additionally,
        Guevara was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal guerrilla
        warfare manual, along with a best-selling memoir about his youthful
        continental motorcycle journey. His experiences and studying of
        Marxism–Leninism led him to posit that the Third World's
        underdevelopment and dependence was an intrinsic result of imperialism,
        neocolonialism, and monopoly capitalism, with the only remedy being
        proletarian internationalism and world revolution.[13][14] Guevara left
        Cuba in 1965 to foment continental revolutions across both Africa and
        South America,[15] first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in
        Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and
        summarily executed.[16]
