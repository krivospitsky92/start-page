      <b class="p-color"><i>Ernesto "Che" Guevara </i></b> (Spanish: [ˈtʃe
      ɣeˈβaɾa];[3] 14 May 1928[4] – 9 October 1967) was a Cuban-Argentinian
      Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and
      military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized
      visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and a
      global insignia in popular culture.[5]

      As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and
      was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed.[6][7]
      His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist
      exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his
      involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz,
      whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit
      Company solidified Guevara's political ideology.[6] Later in Mexico City,
      Guevara met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and
      sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with the intention of overthrowing
      U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.[8] Guevara soon rose to
      prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and
      played a pivotal role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the
      Batista regime.[9]

      Following the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in
      the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads
      for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary
      tribunals,[10] instituting agrarian land reform as minister of industries,
      helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign, serving as
      both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba's armed
      forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban
      socialism. Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in
      training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion,[11] and
      bringing Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to Cuba, which preceded
      the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.[12] Additionally, Guevara was a prolific
      writer and diarist, composing a seminal guerrilla warfare manual, along
      with a best-selling memoir about his youthful continental motorcycle
      journey. His experiences and studying of Marxism–Leninism led him to posit
      that the Third World's underdevelopment and dependence was an intrinsic
      result of imperialism, neocolonialism, and monopoly capitalism, with the
      only remedy being proletarian internationalism and world
      revolution.[13][14] Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment continental
      revolutions across both Africa and South America,[15] first unsuccessfully
      in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by
      CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.[16]

      <h3>Medical school and Motorcycle Diaries: early life</h3>
      <p>
        Guevara was the eldest of five children in a middle-class family of
        Spanish-Irish descent and leftist leanings. Although suffering from
        asthma, he excelled as an athlete and a scholar, completing his medical
        studies in 1953. He spent many of his holidays traveling in Latin
        America, and his observations of the great poverty of the masses
        contributed to his eventual conclusion that the only solution lay in
        violent revolution. He came to look upon Latin America not as a
        collection of separate nations but as a cultural and economic entity,
        the liberation of which would require an intercontinental strategy.

      <h3>The Cuban Revolution</h3>

        He left Guatemala for Mexico, where he met the Cuban brothers Fidel and
        Raúl Castro, political exiles who were preparing an attempt to overthrow
        the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba. Guevara joined Fidel
        Castro’s 26th of July Movement, which landed a force of 81 men
        (including Guevara) in the Cuban province of Oriente on December 2,
        1956. Immediately detected by Batista’s army, they were almost wiped
        out. The few survivors, including the wounded Guevara, reached the
        Sierra Maestra, where they became the nucleus of a guerrilla army. The
        rebels slowly gained in strength, seizing weapons from Batista’s forces
        and winning support and new recruits. Guevara had initially come along
        as the force’s doctor, but he had also trained in weapons use, and he
        became one of Castro’s most-trusted aides. Indeed, the complex Guevara,
        though trained as a healer, also, on occasion, acted as the executioner
        (or ordered the execution) of suspected traitors and deserters. He
        recorded the two years spent overthrowing Batista’s government in
        Pasajes de la guerra revolucionaria (1963; Reminiscences of the Cuban
        Revolutionary War, 1968).
